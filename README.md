# ShadowCast
Cast Shadows on your html elements from the mouse cursor, as if it were a source of light. The shadows react to the movement of a cursor.

Simply add the class, "shadowed" to any html element. Make sure to attach shadow.css and shadow.js to a page's resources. The rest will be automatic. Any element with the "shadowed" class will have box shadows cast from them as if a light source is coming from a user's mouse cursor.
